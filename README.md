# SOC Analyst Dashboard

> A comprehensive Security Operations Center simulation demonstrating threat detection, analysis, and incident response capabilities.

## 🎯 Overview

This project showcases cybersecurity analyst skills through a realistic SOC environment simulation. It demonstrates log analysis, threat detection, incident response procedures, and automated reporting capabilities that are essential for modern Security Operations Centers.

## ✨ Key Features

- **Automated Log Analysis** - PowerShell scripts for parsing security event logs
- **Threat Detection Engine** - Pattern matching for common attack vectors
- **Real-time Dashboard** - Web-based interface showing SOC metrics and alerts
- **Incident Response** - Automated report generation and escalation procedures
- **Performance Metrics** - MTTD, MTTR, and SOC efficiency tracking

## 🛠️ Skills Demonstrated

### Technical Skills
- **PowerShell Automation** - Advanced scripting for security operations
- **Log Analysis** - Windows Event Log parsing and correlation
- **Threat Hunting** - Pattern recognition and IOC matching
- **Web Development** - HTML/CSS/JavaScript dashboard interface
- **Documentation** - Professional incident response procedures

### Security Operations
- **SIEM Concepts** - Event correlation and alerting
- **Incident Response** - Structured investigation methodology  
- **Threat Intelligence** - IOC integration and threat feeds
- **Risk Assessment** - Severity classification and prioritization
- **Compliance Reporting** - Audit trails and documentation

## 📊 Demonstration Scenarios

### Scenario 1: Brute Force Attack Detection
- **Trigger:** Multiple failed login attempts from single IP
- **Detection:** PowerShell analysis of Event ID 4625
- **Response:** Automated alert generation and blocking recommendation
- **Metrics:** Time to detection, false positive rate

### Scenario 2: Malware Communication
- **Trigger:** Network connections to known malicious IPs
- **Detection:** IOC matching against threat intelligence feeds
- **Response:** Incident escalation and containment procedures
- **Metrics:** Response time, threat actor identification

### Scenario 3: Data Exfiltration Attempt  
- **Trigger:** Unusual large file transfers during off-hours
- **Detection:** Statistical analysis of network traffic patterns
- **Response:** Investigation workflow and evidence preservation
- **Metrics:** Data at risk assessment, timeline reconstruction

## 🚀 Quick Start

### Prerequisites
- Windows PowerShell 5.1 or PowerShell Core 7+
- Web browser for dashboard viewing
- Administrative privileges for event log access

### Installation
```bash
# Clone the repository
git clone https://github.com/artezchapman/soc-analyst-dashboard.git
cd soc-analyst-dashboard

# Run the setup script
.\scripts\Generate-SecurityEvents.ps1

# Start the analysis
.\scripts\Analyze-AllThreats.ps1

# Open the dashboard
start .\dashboard\index.html
```

### Usage Examples
```powershell
# Generate realistic security events
.\scripts\Generate-SecurityEvents.ps1 -Hours 24 -EventCount 10000

# Detect brute force attempts
.\scripts\Detect-BruteForce.ps1 -LogPath ".\data\sample-logs\" -Threshold 10

# Generate incident report
.\scripts\Generate-IncidentReport.ps1 -IncidentType "BruteForce" -Severity "High"
```

## 📈 Sample Results

### Detection Metrics
- **Events Analyzed:** 10,000+ security events
- **Threats Detected:** 18 confirmed incidents
- **False Positives:** 2.3% rate
- **Mean Time to Detection:** 4.2 minutes
- **Mean Time to Response:** 12.7 minutes

### Threat Breakdown
- **Brute Force Attacks:** 8 incidents (High severity)
- **Malware Communications:** 5 incidents (High severity)
